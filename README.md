# Othello
From 2008: Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) and playing a game of Othello. Also, Greedy Player, Random Player, and Human Player. This is grad school. More fun times.

# Background
Othello (or reversi) is a well-known board game. Here, you can train or play a Q-Learning Player against a Greedy, Random, or Human player. You can play any other combination, as well.
Check SimpleDriver's main method to see how to play against other players. This is research code and results (such as win/loss message) will appear in the console vs as a GUI message prompt. Work was done in collaboration with another teammate.
